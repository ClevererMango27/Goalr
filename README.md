#Goalr
Somethimes, people have things they wish to achieve at some point in their life. That goal may be to one day go to a good school, work at the wel-paying job, or be successful. That goal may be a short-term goal, such as: getting an A+ on a test or finish a project on time. Whatever your goal is, GoalrÂ© is at you side.

Inspired by a speech about proper goal setting, Brendon Ho strived to create in app that would help achieve people's goals. He started on the project himself, but later invited Ivan to help out on the project. Hopefully, the project is successful, and we hope to release this website at around April. But you can see our progress here(https://goalr.herokuapp.com)
