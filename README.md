###Code Docs
Goalr is a web (and eventually mobile?) platform. It will soon come to iOS and Android.

NodeJS and Express power our backend.

Parse Push is used for dynamic notifications on mobile devices (iOS is our first deployment target).

Jade, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Material are used in our frontend to dynamically create pages for the user.
