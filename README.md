###Code Docs
Goalr is a web (and eventually mobile?) platform. It will soon come to iOS (once we get money), and Android. Not Microsoft or Blackberry platforms.

NodeJS and Express power our backend.

Jade, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Material are used in our frontend to dynamically create pages for the user.

iOS app uses Swift and the Android app will use Java
